    <p style="font-size:20px">PChat is an iOS app that is sort of a blend of Yik-Yak and Tinychat.  You can create chatrooms that are only accessable by people in a certain radius.  Use it to talk to people in class during a boring lecture, see who's in the Library, create chatgroups for your club without getting everyones number, etc.  The project was made in Xcode, and Parse was used for the back end.</p>
